India's 140M+ farmers struggle with fragmented info across 10+ govt portals, manufacturer sites &amp; dealers. Key gaps:no unified tool catalogs w/ reviews &amp; guidance;scattered pesticide/fertilizer data sans pros/cons; disjointed seed databases;  crop-only market prices, missing apiculture/poultry/fish/livestock;scattered state policies w/o tracking.
