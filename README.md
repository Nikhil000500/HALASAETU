 India's 140+ million farmers face fragmented information ecosystems requiring access to 10+ separate government portals, manufacturer websites, and local dealers to make informed agricultural decisions. Current gaps include: lack of comprehensive tool catalogs with user reviews and expert guidance; scattered pesticide/fertilizer information without pros/cons analysis; disconnected seed variety databases across institutes; real-time market price data limited to crops, excluding value-added sectors (apiculture, poultry, pisciculture, animal husbandry); state-speci c government policy information scattered across multiple portals without tracking mechanisms.
Kisan Samriddhi’s solution: A single AI‑powered mobile and web platform that aggregates data from 25+ government and private sources into five integrated modules (tools, pesticides/fertilizers, seeds, market intelligence, and government policies), offers multi‑language, video‑based, personalized guidance, and helps farmers take faster, better agricultural decisions from one unified app.​
